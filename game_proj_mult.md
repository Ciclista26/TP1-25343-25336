# Synopsis
The theme of this game is "Survivor-like tower defense". But how does it work? In the Survivor-like genre, hordes of enemies come from all sides of the screen to attack the player. At the beginning, there are only a few enemies, but the rate at which they spawn increases as time goes by. The goal of the game is to survive for a certain amount of time. What differs in our game is what the enemies are attacking. That's where the tower defense component comes into play. Since the enemies aren't after the player, but instead targeting a castle in the center of the map, the player has to defend the tower. To do this, the player can use a tower defense staple - building towers in order to better defend the castle and also use the gun that the player has.

## Rules
The rules are quite simple, use the players gun and towers in order to defend the castle. If the castle is attacked it loses life, if it loses to much life you loose.

## Game Modes
#### Classic
The classic formula of tower defense games with a castle in the center of the map and point and click mechanics.
#### Alternative
Still a castle in the middle of the map but you can you can control a player that moves in directions and can shoot. It's damage is not spetacular but in the early phases of the game it's really helpful.

## Towers
There are 4 types of towers:
- Wood Tower, a simple wooden tower, cheap but weak, has low energy and does 2 damage.
- Flameturret the baconizer., a flame inducing tower which excells in the close range, has an high area damage but a slow attack.
- The laser lad (Lasad!)., a laser in a tower (crazy), each bullet does only 0.2 damage, however it fires every frame making it the highest DPS (damage per second) in the game.
- Kill me Camper, is the deadliest tower in the game with a 5 damage hit, can insta-kill any creature but it comes with a cost, low fire-rate.
